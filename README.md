# instagram scraper

instagramScraper is an application written in Python that crawls and scrapes an instagram user's posts and comments. 

It fetches a list of desired number of links to posts by any user, the caption for each post, the number of likes and the timestamp of when the post was done.
From the posts it saves the comments, username of the commenting person and the timestamp as well.

In order to get access to more posts, it also can log you in into your account.
If you use the authentication, the program will cache the user session by default so one doesn't need to create a new session every time.

With the database functionality you can save everything in a database. Here PostgreSQL.

Please use responsibly.
